# Getting Started with Weather Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## A Weather App

Including completed tasks:

- Set up a React project.

- Integrate the OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data based on user input.

- Build user interface (UI) components, including a search bar and weather display.

- Enhance user experience with features like auto-complete and visual
representations of weather conditions.

- Ensure responsiveness and mobile-friendliness using CSS media queries or a responsive design framework.

- Handle error cases, such as invalid locations or API failures, with appropriate error messages.

- Thoroughly test the application.

- Document code, explain component functionality, and follow best practices for code organization and readability.

## Comments and other solutions

```bash
const [data, setData] = useState({});
```
 // decalres data used to fetch data from the API and update the data state afterwards ^

```bash
const [location, setLocation] = useState("");
```
// declares location parameter extacted by the API and used in the return -> input section ^

```bash
axios 
      .get(url)
      .then((response) => {
        setData(response.data);
        console.log(response.data);
      })
```
// initialing Axios GET request ^

```bash
<div className="temperature">
            {data.main ? <h1>{data.main.temp.toFixed()} Â°C</h1> : null}
</div>
 ```
 // returning API data (weather.json) through ternary operator ^
```bash
const inputRef = useRef(null); // Create a ref to the input element

  const initMap = () => {
    // Initialize Google Places Autocomplete
    const autocomplete = new window.google.maps.places.Autocomplete(
      inputRef.current
    );

    // Listen for place selection
    autocomplete.addListener("place_changed", () => {
      const selectedPlace = autocomplete.getPlace();
      if (
        selectedPlace &&
        selectedPlace.geometry &&
        selectedPlace.geometry.location
      ) {
        setLocation(selectedPlace.formatted_address);
      }
    });
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    // Check if the Google Maps API is already loaded
    if (window.google && window.google.maps) {
      initMap();
    } else {
      // The API hasn't loaded yet, you can handle this case or retry later
    }
  }, []);
  ```
 // Triggering Google (Places and Maps JS) API ^
